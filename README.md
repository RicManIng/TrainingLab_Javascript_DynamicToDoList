- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks directly through the interface.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks using the delete button associated with each item.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Use a checkbox to mark tasks as completed, updating their status visually.
- **Dynamic JSON Update**: Every operation (add, edit, delete, complete) updates a JSON object, which is then logged to the console.
- **Responsive Design**: The web app is responsive and works on various screen sizes.

## Technical Specifications
